This plugin lets you user the users table from a Drupal 7 installation to authenticate users on a Wordpress 3.9+ installation. It is based on the external-database-authentication module that worked fine while Drupal was using plain old MD5 hashes for passwords. 
CALI is using this plugin in production on our Classcaster blogging and podcasting network.
